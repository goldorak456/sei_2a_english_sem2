%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Structure of the Radio Advertisement Speech :

1. Noisy Sounds complicated to be heared to introduce the problem we are trying to fix with
  our product.

2.  Introducing the issue
Interviewer - You didn't heared a thing did you ? It's coz you're using such a low-qulity mic to record. TODAY !!!......Our solution to your zoom classes' issue ! let us introduce a text-to-speech device to our weekly show "Techy things that made your life you weren't aware of". Hey, guy1, tell us about it !
You are listening to our weekly science podcast with our today's guests :  Nyna Rotip a professor at the polytech of Nice school and Onarsep Calu a Teacher at Cambridge University.

3. Student distant communication issues

+Guest1 - The tts that has been developped by Mexico City team of researchers is a MASSIVE breakthrough ! It is an open source AI driven voice detector that would analyze you speech and translate it to text.
          Get over with quarantine solitude ! This new tech could fundamentelly change our internet interactions
+Interviewer - Hey guest2, as an expert in social interaction, do you agree with that statement?
+Guest2 - Yes I do. Allow students to fake distant conversation even when 'typing', no need for a high quality microphone nor a fast internet connection. It could change the way we interact online, and we
          know how internet is full of consequences on our so-called "real-life".

+Guset1 - you what ? We are proposing them a gold solution to their issue, why would they not get satisfied with that ?
+Guest2 -

What voices are essential? Is there a narrator? What is her or his role?

  An interviwer, questionning the the device, and its developper, demonstrating its usefullness.

Will you interview anyone? Who? Using what questions? Where?

  A debate between two person about the device potential use.
  The two men would not be commercial or lawyers, just two randoms discussing ethics.
  One would suggest the device could vome to great help for deaf people, and even more (trials, students), but the second one would say to let disabled people decide.

Will you use existing news clips to comment/ parts of speeches: which ones?

  Not sure yet.

Will the podcast include storytelling? What stories will be included? What moment or scene will make the story unforgettable? How can you illustrate it in a way that’s interesting? Why would your audience want to listen to this? Is there a big, compelling idea? A character whose story should be prioritized? An emotional or intellectual thread that can run throughout the story? Are there ear- grabbing ways to attract the audience?

  What if a wheeling chair had more consequences on the overall population than on disabled people ? Today we're speaking about thech that made your life that you didn't expected to find there.

What transition will tie the pieces together? What will give the story personality?

  "funny" introduction to what the text-to-speech is
  the two reply to each other objection in the debate

Will the radio show include sound effects or music? Make a list. If you’re telling a story about the mayor of my town, you’ll try to go have an audio of him leading a town hall meeting, talking to his constituents, and even doing day-to-day activities, that you can play during the show. OR Let's say you're heading to a protest in front of my local town hall. You're heading into a "scene" that you might want to describe — and include sound from — in your show. In your show, what sounds should you include?
Compile a list of sounds you'd like to use OR record (see below for links to free online material).

  The sound of the Doctor WHO telephone travelling machine. (Beginning and end)

What ideas do you have for the beginning and ending of the podcast?  Edna Buchanan, the legendary, Pulitzer Prize-winning crime reporter for the Miami Herald, once said that a good lead (beginning sentence) should make a reader sitting at breakfast with his wife “spit out his coffee, clutch his chest and say, ‘My god, Martha. Did you read this?’”

  Beginning : weird noise of a broken microphone, that would surprise the audience
  Ending : the two most kindly agree 'it is more complicated that is simply looks, things have consequences'

What will the audience remember when it’s over?  We rarely remember entire stories; more often, it’s particular quotes, scenes, characters or ideas: What will it be for yours?

  End-user are really important, and any new technologies developpment should focus on the consequences it will have for them.
  "We live in a complex system with interactions, everyhting have consequences that you might have missed."

Make a rough outline of your podcats show.
